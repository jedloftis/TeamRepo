* Background: JP Morgan Chase is a multinational bank and investment holding company with over two and a half trillion dollars in assets. There only real competitors are the other trillion dollar US banks:  Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs

Questions 2: How does this company use technology to their advantage? Why are they considered a FinTech company? 

JPM created The Financial Solutions Lab to find fintech talent and then provide capital and network connections for promising start up ventures where they have invested $30mm to date. The need to invest in Fintech was started due to the notion that they would be eventually made obsolete by the likes of Amazon. They also made significant investments in talent by hiring the Chair of ML at Carnegie Mellon to establish an AI research capability at the Bank with the ulimate goal of infusing AI into "every aspect of the Bank's business". 

With the above in mind, JPM are considered an FinTech Company because their aim is to improve traditional financial methods in the delivery of financial services with technology and innovation.
